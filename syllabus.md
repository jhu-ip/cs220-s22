**Syllabus**\
**Computer Science EN.601.220**\
**Intermediate Programming**\
**Spring 2022 (4 credits, E, in person)**

*(The instructors reserve the right to make adjustments to this
syllabus as deemed necessary with notice.)*

**Course Description**

-   This course teaches intermediate to advanced programming, using C
    and C++. (Prior knowledge of these languages is not expected, but
    prior programming experience and a general understanding of basic
    object-oriented programming are expected.) We will cover low-level
    programming techniques, as well as object-oriented class design, and
    the use of class libraries. Specific topics include pointers,
    dynamic memory allocation, polymorphism, overloading, inheritance,
    templates, collections, exceptions, and others as time permits.
    Students are expected to learn the syntax and some language-specific
    features independently. Course work involves significant programming
    projects in both languages.

-   **Prerequisites**\
    Gateway Computing (AP CS, EN.500.112/113/114/132/133/134, or
    equivalent)\
    Students are expected to be able to create and run simple programs
    and object-oriented solutions in a general-purpose programming
    language (such as Java or Python) prior to enrolling in this course.

**General Course Philosophy**

This course will focus more on learning than on assessment. While we
will use grades to let you know how you are doing, we hope that your
goal is learning the material, rather than "getting a good grade." In
the end, the best way to get a good grade is to develop an interest in
learning and engage with the material in a self-directed fashion.
Besides, in the long run, the knowledge and skills you acquire are far
more important than the grade is.

That said, be aware that the main difficulty many students have with
this course is **time management**. It will be a lot of work, and if you
don't budget your time well, you may find yourself with a grade that
does not reflect how well you understand the material. Additionally,
while there are lots of resources provided to help you succeed, we
cannot force you to use them; it is important to avail yourself of these
resources, particularly office hours.

**Course Approach** We take a flipped-classroom approach to the course,
with an emphasis on active learning during class sessions. Part of your
homework will be to prepare for class by watching video lessons. During
class sessions you will extend your learning by working with your
instructors and classmates to discuss new concepts and apply them to
in-class exercises, rather than listening to a lecture.

**Expectations & Grading**

All students are generally expected to actively participate in the
scheduled sessions of this course by answering and asking questions and
solving the learning exercises. You are also expected to learn via the
posted material, assignments, and projects. Our class time will include
a recap of the new material, discussion on the important concepts,
review of previous exercises, and live coding exercises. Before each
session, students are expected to go through the related material posted
on the course website and/or Piazza, and finish the coding exercises
from the prior session.

Students will be expected to complete a variety of computer programming
assignments, as well as written homework assignments. Some assignments
may be done in pairs or groups as specified; others must be completed
alone. See the specific assignment page for details of what is permitted
for a particular assignment. Failure to follow these guidelines will be
a violation of the academic ethics code, and reported and penalized
accordingly.

While code reuse is an important feature of modern programming, for this
course, you will be expected to write most of the code for your homework
assignments from scratch. You may use language libraries (according to
assignment specifications), and you may always reuse your own code from
prior work in the course. Downloading full or partial solutions from the
internet, however, is an ethics violation. Using code from class
examples, slides, or the textbook is acceptable, but you must cite the
source properly in a comment in your code describing the original
source.

There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. The midterm exam will
cover the topics of the first half of the class (C material) and the
final exam will focus on the second half (C++ material). The exams are
designed to assess your knowledge of programming in C and C++ as well as
your problem solving ability, but not your knowledge of specific tools
or technologies discussed in class.

Homework assignments are expected to take a considerable amount of time;
start early and budget your time well. On average, it may take 5-15
hours per week, depending on the assignment and your approach.
Additionally, try to use incremental development so that even if you run
out of time, you can still turn in code that implements some of the
desired functionality (with a README file and comments explaining what's
missing). Keep in mind that half the features working all the way will
get you a lot more partial credit than all the features half-way
working. Good use of the version control system will significantly help
with your incremental development. For each commit, you should update
your README file to outline what's missing and what's done, and try to
keep each commit a submittable version. This is a good practice, and can
come in very handy in case you accidentally delete the local copy of
your homework!

Students are expected to learn material outside of class time and
homework, as well. We will generally provide links to tutorials,
references, and other resources for each topic. Students are expected to
read these, as well as seek out other resources on their own to further
their understanding of topics. There is a wealth of programming
information on the internet; if one explanation doesn't make sense, you
can probably find another that does.\
**Homework policy**

Assignments will be due **by 11:00 pm on the due date** (unless
otherwise indicated on the course Piazza site). Non-compiling code will
earn a score of zero, so students are strongly encouraged to
double-check that all submitted code fully compiles with no errors or
warnings in the standard course compilation environment. We will
accommodate late submissions in several specific ways:

-   There will be a 30-minute grace period after the deadline during
    which assignments can still be submitted, but will receive a penalty
    of a deduction of 10% of the points possible on the assignment.

-   Each student will be permitted to use up to 4 "late days" total
    during the semester on the individual coding assignments only.
    However, at most 2 late days may be used on any one assignment.

-   Each delay of up to 24 hours past the 11:00 pm deadline for an
    individual coding assignment counts as one late day.

-   No late days are allowed for handwritten homework or partner-based
    coding projects.

-   Students may not use a grace period with a late day. For example, if
    Student A turns in her homework at 11:45 pm on the day it is due
    (only 45 minutes past the original deadline), then she will be using
    one late day. Furthermore, if Student B turns in his homework at
    11:15 pm on the day after it is due, he'll be using two late days.

Given these policies, please plan to get your homework done and turned
in early so that if you encounter any last-minute delays, it will not
hurt you too badly. Additionally, Gradescope will allow multiple
submission attempts; we will simply grade the last one. So it's a good
idea to develop your program incrementally, and turn in a
fully-compiling (if only partially complete) version every day or so.\
Deadline exceptions can only be made by an instructor (not TAs/CAs), and
will only be considered in the circumstances outside the control of the
student (e.g., serious illness, death of a relative, etc.). If you must
request an exception, do so as early as possible; it is easier to get an
exception if you ask before an assignment is due, rather than after. No
exceptions will be given for failure to plan ahead or simply having
\"too much work.\"\
**In-class Exercises**

Many of the course topics will be supported by an exercise. Although
these exercises do not count towards your course grade, they are a very
important part of your learning, and as such we *strongly* recommend
that you complete them fully. We will review the solutions to these
exercises either fully or just the important parts in class sessions. In
general, we will *not* post solutions to the in-class exercises --- if
you are having trouble completing an exercise, seek help office hours,
or on Piazza. We will have an option for you to submit your solutions on
gradescope and get autograder feedback on them.

**Grading Breakdown**

-   6% - handwritten homework (3 total; due dates vary, will be listed
    on Piazza)

-   30% - individual coding homework (4.5 total; due dates vary, will be
    listed on Piazza)

-   14% - midterm coding project (in teams)

-   17% - midterm exam (Monday, October 18)

-   16% - final coding project (in teams)

-   17% - final exam (date to be scheduled by the Registrar)

All scores and grader commentary on your homework and project
submissions, as well as exams, will be available via Gradescope. Please
keep your own record of your grades so that you will know your standing
in the course. At the end of the term, letter grades are generally
assigned according to the following scale. You should not expect a curve
in this course.

Interval | Letter grade
:------: | :----------:
\[97,100\] | A+
\[93,97\) | A
\[90,93\) | A-
\[87, 90\) | B+
\[83,87\) | B
\[80,83\) | B-
\[77, 80\) | C+
\[73,77\) | C
\[70,73\) | C-
\[67, 70\) | D+
\[60,67\) | D
\[ 0,60\) | F

**Classroom Climate**

As your instructors, we are committed to creating a classroom
environment that values the diversity of experiences and perspectives
that all students bring. Everyone here has the right to be treated with
dignity and respect. We believe that fostering an inclusive climate is
important because research and my experience show that students who
interact with peers who are different from themselves learn new things
and experience tangible educational outcomes. Please join us in creating
a welcoming and vibrant classroom climate. Note that you should expect
to be challenged intellectually by instructors, the course assistants
(CAs), and your peers, and at times this may feel uncomfortable. Indeed,
it can be helpful to be pushed sometimes in order to learn and grow. But
at no time in this learning process should someone be singled out or
treated unequally on the basis of any seen or unseen part of their
identity.

If you ever have concerns in this course about harassment,
discrimination, or any unequal treatment, or if you seek accommodations
or resources, we invite you to share directly with the instructor or
CAs. We promise that we will take your communication seriously and to
seek mutually acceptable resolutions and accommodations. Reporting will
never impact your course grade. You may also share concerns with the
Department Head (Randal Burns, [
randal@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:randal@cs.jhu.edu)), the Director of
Undergraduate Studies (Joanne Selinski, <joanne@cs.jhu.edu>), the
Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion (Darlene Saporu,
<dsaporu1@jhu.edu>), or the Office of Institutional Equity
(<oie@jhu.edu>). In handling reports, people will protect your privacy
as much as possible, but faculty and staff are required to officially
report information for some cases (e.g. sexual harassment).

We hope that all students will be able to actively participate in all
course meetings. Out of respect for your fellow students, be sure to
attend on time each day. If you miss a classroom meeting for whatever
reason, you are responsible for the material presented. Also, when
attending zoom office hours please use your full name in your zoom
account settings, and add your picture to your Zoom profile.

-   Student Outreach & Support will be fully operational (virtually) to
    help support students. Students can self-refer or refer a friend who
    may need extra support or help getting connected to resources. To
    connect with SOS, please email <mailto:deanofstudents@jhu.edu>, call
    410-516-7857, or students can schedule to meet with a Case Manager
    by visiting the Student Outreach & Support website and follow
    "Schedule an Appointment".

**Family Accommodations Policy**

You are welcome to bring a family member to class on occasional days
when your responsibilities require it (for example, if emergency
childcare is unavailable, or for health needs of a relative). In fact,
you may see children in class on days when their school is closed.
Please be sensitive to the classroom environment, and if your family
member becomes uncomfortably disruptive, you may leave the classroom and
return as needed.

**University Policy on Incompletes**

The university recognizes that the Fall 2021 semester is surrounded with
uncertainty and many students may find themselves in unexpected
situations where study is difficult if not impossible. Students who are
confronted with extraordinary circumstances that interfere with their
ability perform their academic work may request an incomplete grade from
the instructor. While approval of such a request is not automatic, it is
expected that faculty will make every effort to accommodate students
dealing with illness in the family and other pandemic-related hardships.
The instructor and student must establish a timetable for submitting the
unfinished work with a final deadline no later than the end of the third
week of the Spring 2022 semester. Exceptions to this deadline require a
petition from the instructor to the student's academic advising office
before that date. When entering an Incomplete grade in SIS, faculty must
include a reversion grade which represents the grade the student will
receive if s/he does not complete the missing work by the agreed-upon
deadline.

**Deadlines for Adding, Dropping and Withdrawing from Courses**

Students may add a course up to Friday, Sept. 10. They may drop courses
up to October, 2021 provided they remain registered for a minimum of 12
credits. Between October 10 and November 12, 2021, a student may
withdraw from a course with a W on their academic record. A record of
the course will remain on the academic record with a W appearing in the
grade column to indicate that the student registered and then withdrew
from the course. For more information on these and other academic
policies, see

**Ethics**

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by
the *Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy*:

> Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining
> academic integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair
> competition. The university will punish cheaters with failure on an
> assignment, failure in a course, permanent transcript notation,
> suspension, and/or expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law
> or other professional or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
>
> Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of
> assignments without permission, improper use of the Internet and
> electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded
> assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic
> dishonesty, and unfair competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an
> excuse.
>
> Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded.
> Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all
> homework and programming assignments without the help of others. For
> example, you must not look at anyone else's solutions (including
> program code) to your homework problems. However, you may discuss
> assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure you
> understand what is required by the assignment.
>
> If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside
> sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly
> cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your
> group projects must list everyone who participated.
>
> Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
>
> Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for
> particular assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if
> you are not sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the
> instructor, TA or CAs, as you are always encouraged to do, rather than
> from other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may
> have received.
>
> On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: \"I agree to
> complete this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person,
> materials or device. \[Signed and dated\]\". Your course instructors
> will let you know where to find copies of old exams, if they are
> available.

In addition, the specific ethics guidelines for this course are as
follows:

1.  This course is about learning, and encourages collaboration toward
    that end. In general, if a collaborative act helps you to learn, it
    is probably permitted. If, on the other hand, it helps you avoid
    learning, it is not permitted. For example, helping your friend
    learn how to use the debugger is great. Helping your friend by
    debugging their code for them is bad, because your friend will never
    learn how to do it by watching you. A main focus of this course is
    learning skills, and you can't acquire skills without practice.
    Therefore, \"helping\" other students by allowing them to skip the
    practice endangers the learning outcomes of the course, and is
    prohibited. Helping other students practice more efficiently and
    effectively (e.g. not waste 3 hours trying to fix one bug), on the
    other hand, actively supports the learning goals of the course, and
    is not only allowed, but encouraged.

2.  In general, when helping another student, never do something for
    them; instead, try to think like a teacher and \"teach\" them how to
    do it themselves. This will help you both learn, since teaching
    something is a great way of learning more about it as well.

    -   Asking a friend to let you look at their working code is not
        allowed, nor is offering to let someone else look at your
        working code.

    -   If a friend is helping you to debug, you should only share the
        minimal amount of buggy code necessary.

    -   In general, when helping others, think \"teach, not \"do\".

    -   Always thank anyone who helped you on a given assignment in your
        README file.

    -   The two coding projects for this course will allow for and
        encourage collaboration in teams. There are no limits to
        communication within a team, but work should be done \"as a
        team\" with all members present; don't just split the assignment
        into pieces and work on separate parts. No working source code
        should be shared outside your team.

Report any violations you witness to the instructor.
