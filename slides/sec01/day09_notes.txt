Exercise 8 review

Checking whether result capacity is sufficient:

   int word1_len = strlen(word1);
   int word2_len = strlen(word2);

   if (word1_len + word2_len + 1 > result_capacity) { return 0; }

Concatenating word1 and word2, placing concatenation in result

  - copy all characters from word1 into result
  - copy all characters from word2 into result
  - place NUL terminator after all of the characters from
    word1 and word2


Modularizing the program

main function goes in run_concat.c

concat function goes in string_functions.c

function declaration goes in string_functions.h

  it should look like this:

    #ifndef STRING_FUNCTIONS_H
    #define STRING_FUNCTIONS_H

    int concat(const char word1[], const char word2[], char result[], int result_capacity);

    #endif // STRING_FUNCTIONS_H

both run_concat.c and string_functions.c should

    #include "string_functions.h"


Editing the Makefile

  The Makefile is already set up correctly. All that should be needed
  is to edit the file names.

  If it's working correctly and you run "make" for the first time, it should
  run the following commands:

    gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -c run_concat.c
    gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -c string_functions.c
    gcc -o run_concat run_concat.o string_functions.o


What happens when the user enters more than 10 characters for a
string?

  scanf will store characters past the end of the array. This is
  undefined behavior, and will generally corrupt other variables in
  the program.

  If the overrun is large enough, the main function's return address
  will be corrupted, and the program will (likely) segfault when
  it tries to return.



Day 9 recap questions

1. How do you declare a multi-dimensional array and pass it to a function?
2. How do you initialize a multi-dimensional array using array initialization?
3. What is the compile flag needed to compile a program such that we can debug it using gdb?
4. How do you set a break point using gdb and check the call stack?
5. Check the gdb cheat sheet and find the command to print the content of a variable per step, instead of only printing it once using `print`.

1. E.g. a two dimensional array:

  int chessboard[8][8];

For 2-D arrays, first dimension is "rows" and second dimension is "columns".

Passing to a function:

  int is_checkmate(int board[8][8]) {
    // ...code...
  }

Note that the size of the first array dimension can be omitted, but the sizes of
the other array dimensions are required.

2. E.g.:

  // assume 0=empty, 1=pawn, 2=rook, 3=knight, 4=bishop, 5=king, 6=queen
  // note that we should really have #define constants or an enum
  // type so that these values can have meaningful names

  int chessboard[8][8] = {
    { 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 },
    { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
    // etc. for other rows
  };

3. -g: is required when compiling, but not required when linking

4. break name_of_function
   break source_filename.c:N    (N is the line number)

   backtrace

5. display name_of_variable
