## Overview

In this assignment, you will implement an interpreter for a very simple
graphics processing language.  The goal is to write a program which
interprets drawing commands and renders shapes and filled regions on
a drawing surface.

## Concepts

The drawing program will draw pixels on a 2-D grid.  Each pixel has
a color specified by a combination of red, green, and blue color component
values. Each color component value is an integer in the range 0â€“255,
inclusive.

When the program generates an image, the input file will specify the
size of the pixel grid as some number of columns and some number of
rows.  The position of a pixel is specified as a column (x) and row (y)
coordinate.  The upper left pixel in the grid has coordinates x=0, y=0.
X coordinate values increase moving to the right, and y coordinate values
increase moving down.  So, if the pixel grid has 320 columns and 240 rows,
the lower right pixel has coordinates x=319, y=239.

## Image files

Once it has processed all of the drawing commands, the program will save
the final image to a text file.  The text file is a sequence of values.
Values are separated by one or more whitespace characters
(`' '`, `'\t'`, `'\n'`, `'\r'`, etc.)

The first two values are the width and height of the output image,
specifed as unsigned decimal integers.  For example, if the first
two values in an image file are

```
320 240
```

then the image will have 320 columns and 240 rows.
