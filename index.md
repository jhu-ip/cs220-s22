Welcome to the website for Intermediate Programming (Spring 2022) at
<a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>!

*Course description*: This course teaches intermediate to advanced
programming, using C and C++. (Prior knowledge of these languages is not
expected.) We will cover low-level programming techniques, as well as
object-oriented class design, and the use of class libraries. Specific
topics include pointers, dynamic memory allocation, polymorphism,
overloading, inheritance, templates, collections, exceptions, and others
as time permits. Students are expected to learn syntax and some language
specific features independently. Course work involves significant
programming projects in both languages.

All public information about the course (assignments, exercises, etc.) will
be posted on this website.

Use the links at the top of the page to navigate the site.

## Important links

the main communication channel. If you have any questions or concerns,
post on Piazza. You can do either public or private posts (anonymously
if you want!). If others could potentially benefit from your question,
consider making it public. *Never include your homework/project solution
code in a public post.*

<a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a> is used for
assignment submission and handling. You make all your submissions on
Gradescope and recieve feedback and your work in there. Regrade requests
can be made and are processed on Gradescope as well. You get an invitation
